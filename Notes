DOCKER SWARM:
CLUSTER 
NODES
CONTAINER
APP

C: CLUSTER
N: NODE
P: POD
C: CONTAINER
A: APPLICATION

NOTE: k8s dont communicate with containers.
it communicate with pods.

COMPONENTS:
MASTER NODE:
1. API SERVER: its for communicating with cluster, it takes command executes and gives output.
2. ETCD: its a DB od cluster, all the cluster info will store here.
3. SCHEDULER: schedules pods on worker nodes, based on hardware resources.
4. CONTROLLER: used to control the k8s objects.
1. cloud controllers
2. kube controllers

WORKER NODE:
KUBELET: its an agent used to communicate with master.
KUBEPROXY: it deals with nlw.
POD: its a group of containers.


There are multiple ways to setup kubernetes cluster.

1.SELF MANAGER K8'S CLUSTER
a.mini kube (single node cluster)
b.kubeadm(multi node cluster)
c. KOPS

2. CLOUD MANAGED K8'S CLUSTER
a. AWS EKS
b.AZURE AKS
c.GCP GKS
d.IBM IKE

MINIKUBE:
It is a tool used to setup single node cluster on K8's. 
It contains API Servers, ETDC database and container runtime
It is used for development, testing, and experimentation purposes on local. 
Here Master and worker runs on same machine.
It is a platform Independent.

NOTE: But we dont implement this in real-time

REQUIRMENTS:
2 CPUs or more
2GB of free memory
20GB of free disk space
Internet connection
Container or virtual machine manager, such as: Docker.
