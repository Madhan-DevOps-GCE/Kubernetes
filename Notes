DOCKER SWARM:
CLUSTER 
NODES
CONTAINER
APP

C: CLUSTER
N: NODE
P: POD
C: CONTAINER
A: APPLICATION

NOTE: k8s dont communicate with containers.
it communicate with pods.

COMPONENTS:
MASTER NODE:
1. API SERVER: its for communicating with cluster, it takes command executes and gives output.
2. ETCD: its a DB od cluster, all the cluster info will store here.
3. SCHEDULER: schedules pods on worker nodes, based on hardware resources.
4. CONTROLLER: used to control the k8s objects.
1. cloud controllers
2. kube controllers

WORKER NODE:
KUBELET: its an agent used to communicate with master.
KUBEPROXY: it deals with nlw.
POD: its a group of containers.


There are multiple ways to setup kubernetes cluster.

1.SELF MANAGER K8'S CLUSTER
a.mini kube (single node cluster)
b.kubeadm(multi node cluster)
c. KOPS

2. CLOUD MANAGED K8'S CLUSTER
a. AWS EKS
b.AZURE AKS
c.GCP GKS
d.IBM IKE

MINIKUBE:
It is a tool used to setup single node cluster on K8's. 
It contains API Servers, ETDC database and container runtime
It is used for development, testing, and experimentation purposes on local. 
Here Master and worker runs on same machine.
It is a platform Independent.

NOTE: But we dont implement this in real-time

REQUIRMENTS:
2 CPUs or more
2GB of free memory
20GB of free disk space
Internet connection
Container or virtual machine manager, such as: Docker.



PODS:
It is a smallest unit of deployment in K8's.
It is a group of containers.
Pods are ephemeral (short living objects)
Mostly we can use single container inside a pod but if we required, we can create multiple containers inside a same pod.
when we create a pod, containers inside pods can share the same network namespace, and can share the same storage volumes .
While creating pod, we must specify the image, along with any necessary configuration and resource limits.
K8's cannot communicate with containers, they can communicate with only pods.
 We can create this pod in two ways, 
1. Imperative(command) 
2. Declarative (Manifest file)


IMPERATIVE: 
kubectl run pod1 --image madhan/paytmtrain:latest
kubectl get po/pod/pods
kubectl get po/pod/pods -o wide
kubectl describe pod pod1
kubectl delete pod pod1

Declarative:
vim abc.yml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
   name: pod1
spec:
  containers:
    - image: nginx
      name: cont1

kubectl create -f abc.yml
kubectl get po/pod/pods
kubectl get po/pod/pods -o wide
kubectl describe pod pod1
kubectl delete pod pod1
